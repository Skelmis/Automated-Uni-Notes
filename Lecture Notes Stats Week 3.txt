For a sample

 

= The standard deviation is positive.

= It is zero only when all of the data values are the same
number.

= The units of the standard deviation are the same as the
units of the original data values.

Note the use of the divisor of (n - 1) for the
sample variance. This makes the sample
variance an unbiased estimator of the
population variance

Advantages

Disadvantages

It is also in squared units
— hard to have a good idea about what size it is

Coefficient of variation

This is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean
It is usually expressed as a percentage

It measures the spread relative to the average size

Dispersion

- Is the amount of spread or scatter that occurs
in data set

- If values in set are clustered tightly around their
ratsyc la
~ Measured dispersion (std. Dev.) Is small

. If standard deviation is small
- Items bunched around their mean

. If standard deviation is large

Empirical rule
: For distributions that are generally bell shaped,

» Approximately 68% of the observations will lie within
one standard deviation of the mean

» Approximately 95% of the observations will lie within
two standard deviations of the mean

» Approximately 99.7% of the observations will lie within
three standard deviations of the mean
<--->
End Slide

Example 1.13

¢ IQ scores have a bell shaped distribution with a mean
of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.

 

¢ The empirical rule approximately 68% of the
observations will lie within 1 standard deviation of the
mean.
i.e. between 100- 15 = 85 and 100+ 15 = 115

¢ The empirical rule approximately 95% of the
observations will lie within 2 standard deviation of the
mean.

* j.e. between 100 — 2*15 = 70 and 100+ 2*15 = 130

* For the two data sets displayed in the following
histograms, determine which graph has the larger

a) Data set A has a larger standard deviation than data set B.

c) Both data sets have the same standard deviation.

Estimating the mean and variance from
grouped data

With grouped data
— have lost the information about where in the
group each observation lies
- all we know is the group in which each
observation lies

lies at the group midpoint

proportion holds.

i.e. you have a probability p and want an x- value

1. Draw a sketch of the Normal curve centered on the

this proportion and find the z for which this p value
holds.
